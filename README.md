# IceT! Ordering App

This application provides an ordering interface for placing an ice-cream and tea order, favouriting your orders to localStorage, and receiving an order number upon placement. This app was built using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS without frameworks.

Any orders that are favourited are stored in localStorage on the browser and will be loaded into the app upon next visit to the app or reloading.

The order number's are also stored in localStorage so as you place orders the number increases.

There is an arbitrary limit of 10 items specified in the code for the basket to showcase error handling.

The app is made accessible across all device sizes in the browser and v 1.0.0 has been deployed on Netlify.
